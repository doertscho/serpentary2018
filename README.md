serpentary 2018
===============

This is the 2018 version of the serpentary football pool software.

It uses AWS Lambdas written in Go as its backend,
Protocol Buffers as the data exchange format,
and a React app written in TypeScript as a user interface.

This project is built using AWS CodeStar,
the file layout is loosely based on the Go web application template,
but with many changes and additions.
The web app is compiled and packaged using webpack.
